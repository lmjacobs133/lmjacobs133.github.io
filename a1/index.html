    <p>I was born in Buffalo, NY at Millard Fillmore Hospital in the downtown area,  which was demolished on October, 3, 2015.  Both Cheektowaga and Kenmore are suburbs of this city.  To me, Buffalo will always be home -- and I have every intention of moving back there someday.  Please click the button below to see a wonderful, short documentary about my home.</p>
